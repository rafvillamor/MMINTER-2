Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Set two variables(A and B) as the two numbers
Step 3 - Set the variable(C) as the answer
Step 4 - Input numbers into the given variables
Step 5 - To find the answer of the sum, input A + B = C
Step 6 - To find the answer of the difference, input A - B = C
Step 7 - To find the answer of the product, input A * B = C
Step 8 - To find the answer of the quotient, input A / B = C
Step 9 - Stop
